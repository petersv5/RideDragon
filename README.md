Rideable Ender Dragons in Minecraft (Datapack for 1.16+)

This datapack enables players to summon and ride Ender Dragons. 

The data pack is server side only and not needed on clients. It also works for single player worlds.
It is safe to use by multiple players at the same time. 

Dragons are summoned using the Book of Dragons. As an alterantive the player can uise the command 
"/trigger rd_summon". The summoned dragon will be passive and float down to the ground. The dragon
is then mounted by right clicking its neck close to the body with an empty hand.

Players can use "/trigger rd_help" for mor information.

OPs can configure if the Book Of dragons is required to summon a dragon as well as how the book 
can be obtained via the admin interface which is opened with the command "/function ridedragon:admin".


This datapack was inspired by the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBUknTYjylc&t=284s by John 
Paul Inso. That design was not safe for multiple simultaneous players.
